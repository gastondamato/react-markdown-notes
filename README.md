# react-markdown-notes

This was an exercice from [scrimba.com](url) to add functionality to a markdown processor.

It uses **react-mde** to interprete the markdown and add the editing/preview functionality

**react-split** to create a resizeble divider between the elements

and **nanoid** to create unique id's

The objective was to pass props and functions between components to control states from child to parent.
